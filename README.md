# learning-elixir
Bunch of random nonsense files created while running through Elixir's Getting
Started guide which are all in the `chapters/` directory. The `key_value`
directory contains the mix project that the docs walk you through. You can read
about that here, https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction-to-mix.html.
